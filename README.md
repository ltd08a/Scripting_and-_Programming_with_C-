# Scripting_and-_Programming_with_C++

### Project Description
A project to migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. 

### Competencies
1. Introduction to Programming: Apply fundamental programming concepts in a specific programming environment.
2. Variables and Data Types: Prepare code which declares, initializes, and assigns values to variables of appropriate types as part of the application development process.
3. Control Structures: Write code that implements decision and loop constructs to control the flow of a program.
4. Arrays: Create arrays in order to solve complex problems.
5. Pointers and Memory: Apply pointers to solve complex problems.
6. Functions: Write code that creates and manipulates functions and files.
7. Object-Oriented Paradigm: Apply object-oriented programming concepts in order to create a basic application.

### Requirements
The program must contain 2 classes. It will maintain a current roster of students within a given course. This must real a list of 5 students and use function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data, the program should create student objects. The entire student list will be stored in one array of students. Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.

### Files
student.h: Class definition for the 'Student' class  
roster.h: Class definition for the 'Roster' class  
degree.h: Enumeration definition for DegreeProgram  
student.cpp: Contains a default constructor, full constructor, accessor functions, mutator functions, print functions, and a destructor definition for the 'Student' objects  
roster.cpp: Contains a default constructor, full constructor, various functions, and a destructor definition for the 'Roster' objects  
main.cpp: Entry point for the program, displaying the functionality of the project  
Screenshot.png: A screenshot of main.cpp running correctly
